        <p>I've accomplished many things throughout my life, the most signifcant of those accomplishments being varsity volleyball as a sophomore, soloing
        a plane on my 16th birthday and getting my license shortly after.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">First solo (most notable accomplishment)</h2>
        <p>My first solo was an amazing experience, I had about 13 hours of training previous to it so my brain was just in training mode,
        I didn't even realize no one was with me in the plane. It was an overall joyous experience that I've been waiting for my whole life.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Varsity volleyball</h3>
        <p>Being on varsity volleyball as a sophomore was a rather interesting experience, I was treated with great resepect and had an amazing season
        and I'm still doing amazing to this date.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Drivers license</h4>
        <p>This was a significant event in my life solely based off the fact that it opened so many different possibilities for me
        to go out and enjoy luxuries of life I previously didn't have.</p>
